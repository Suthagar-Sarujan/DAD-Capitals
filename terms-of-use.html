                <strong>Risk Disclosure:</strong> Trading in forex, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and other financial
                instruments involves a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The value of your
                investments can go up or down, and you may lose more than your initial capital. Before engaging in any
                trading activities, please ensure you fully understand the risks involved, including the potential for
                significant financial loss. Leverage can work both for and against you. You are strongly advised to
                consult with an independent financial advisor if you are unsure whether trading is right for you. Past
                performance is not indicative of future results.
