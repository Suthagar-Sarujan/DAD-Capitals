        <strong>Risk Disclosure:</strong> Trading in forex, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and other financial
        instruments involves a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The value of your
        investments can go up or down, and you may lose more than your initial capital. Before engaging in any trading
        activities, please ensure you fully understand the risks involved, including the potential for significant
        financial loss. Leverage can work both for and against you. You are strongly advised to consult with an
        independent financial advisor if you are unsure whether trading is right for you. Past performance is not
        indicative of future results.
